Generic eXtra

Just the beginning of my slowly growing standard C macros


TODO
------

* Clean up file headings, license statements etc.
* ifndef ...\_H wrapper around all
* Possibly C++ wrapper around all
* Mark unfinished functions & deprecated ones
* Fill in some known incomplete functions w/ compile-time-errors
* Remove the nonstarter gx\_ * headers
* Possibly clean up namespace and \_gx conventions...
* Allow for different pool names
